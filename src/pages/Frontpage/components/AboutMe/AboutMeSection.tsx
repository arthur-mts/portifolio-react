        Hello! My name is Arthur Soares and i am a software
        enginner, computer technician, mediocre guitarist and lover of good
        music and black coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        I live in the countryside of the Para√≠ba state in Brasil. Here I have fresh
        air, good friends, an amazing family, and the energy to do
        absolutely everything.
      </p>

        <br />I have been studying computer science and writing code since 2016, when I enrolled in the{" "}
        <a href="https://estudante.ifpb.edu.br/cursos/74/">
          IFPB Computer Technican Course
        </a>
        . There I have learned the basis of computer science, web development, operational systems and other things.
        <br />
        At 2019 after I have finished the technican course, I started my{" "}
        <a href="https://estudante.ifpb.edu.br/cursos/28/">
          Computer Engenieering Degree
        </a>{" "}, where I learned more deeply about programming, hardware and worked with real projects that can be found in my GitHub profile.</p>
        <p>
        I started to work with programming effectively in 2020 as a full-stack intern. In 2021 i started working for {" "}
        <a href="https://institucional.ifood.com.br/">
          iFood
        </a>, the biggest food-related tech company
        from America, where i work with backend development, high-demand services, resilient systems and a lot of other things. <br/>
        My biggest goal as a tech professional is to impact positively people around the world using technology and with this achieve my personal goals (support my family and live well basicaly).
